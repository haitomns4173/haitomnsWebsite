		<p>Disaster Rescue Vehicle is a type of all-terrain vehicle which can go in any land structure, in any condition and in any place. During Disasters it not possible for Army to go to places which are flooded or wrecked. Therefore  all-terrain is a solution for it. It can be used to rescue a large number of people at one time  during disasters. It can be controlled by very few number of armies as well as itâ€™s convenient to use.</p>

		<p>This is inspired from the vehicle called Crawler-Transporter which is used by NASA to move rockets from one place to another. This vehicle used 4 caterpillar track system to move in any land structure.  This vehicle is very heavy and powerful. So an idea dropped into our mind to create something like this  in a new innovative way and for a different purpose and we thought that it can be used to go to difficult land structures and save the life of people. In context of Nepal, Every year different natural disasters  keep  on occurring so this type of vehicle is very useful for the army. </p>
